# API Security

## Table of Contents

## Introduction

API security is a critical aspect of modern software development, ensuring that APIs are protected against unauthorized access, data breaches, and other vulnerabilities. This guide provides an overview of essential API security concepts, best practices, and tools to help you secure your APIs effectively.

## API Security Concepts

### Authentication and Authorization

- **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of a user or system accessing the API.
- **Authorization**: Determining whether an authenticated user has permission to perform a specific action.
- **OAuth 2.0**: A widely used authorization framework that allows third-party applications to access user data without sharing credentials. It uses access tokens to grant permissions.
- **OpenID Connect**: An identity layer on top of OAuth 2.0 that provides user authentication and profile information.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. JWTs are often used for authentication and information exchange in APIs.
- **API Keys**: Unique identifiers used to authenticate requests to an API. They are often included in the request header or query parameters.

### Rate Limiting and Throttling

- **Rate Limiting**: Restricting the number of requests a user can make to an API within a specified time period. This helps prevent abuse and ensures fair usage.
- **Throttling**: Slowing down the response rate for users who exceed their allowed request limits. This can help manage server load and prevent denial-of-service attacks.

### Input Validation and Sanitization

- **Input Validation**: Ensuring that incoming data meets specific criteria before processing it. This helps prevent injection attacks, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Sanitization**: Cleaning and transforming input data to remove potentially harmful content. This is especially important for user-generated content or data from untrusted sources.

### Secure Communication

- **HTTPS**: Using HTTPS (HTTP over SSL/TLS) to encrypt data in transit between the client and server. This protects against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)**: A security policy mechanism that helps protect websites against man-in-the-middle attacks by forcing clients to use only HTTPS connections.

### Error Handling and Logging

- **Error Handling**: Implementing proper error handling mechanisms to avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages. Use generic error messages for users while logging detailed errors for developers.
- **Logging**: Capturing API request and response logs to monitor usage patterns, detect anomalies, and troubleshoot issues. Ensure that logs do not contain sensitive information, such as passwords or personal data.

### CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

- **CORS**: A security feature implemented by web browsers that allows or restricts web applications running at one origin to make requests to resources on a different origin. Properly configuring CORS headers is essential to prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests.
- **CORS Headers**: Use headers like `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, and `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` to control which origins can access your API and what methods and headers are allowed.

### Security Testing and Vulnerability Scanning

- **Security Testing**: Regularly testing your APIs for vulnerabilities using tools like static analysis, dynamic analysis, and penetration testing. This helps identify and fix security issues before they can be exploited.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Using automated tools to scan your APIs for known vulnerabilities and security misconfigurations. Tools like OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, and Nessus can help identify potential security risks.

### API Security Standards and Best Practices

- **OWASP API Security Top 10**: A list of the top 10 most critical API security risks, including issues like broken authentication, excessive data exposure, and security misconfiguration.
- **API Security Best Practices**: Following best practices such as using strong authentication methods, implementing rate limiting, validating and sanitizing input, using HTTPS, and regularly testing for vulnerabilities.

## Common API Security Vulnerabilities

### OWASP API Security Top 10 (2023)

Understanding the most common API vulnerabilities is crucial for building secure systems:

#### 1. Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)

- **Description**: APIs fail to validate that a user should have access to a specific object.
- **Example**: User A can access User B's data by simply changing the ID in the API call.
- **Mitigation**: Implement proper authorization checks for every object access.

#### 2. Broken Authentication

- **Description**: Authentication mechanisms are implemented incorrectly, allowing attackers to compromise authentication tokens.
- **Example**: Weak password policies, exposed authentication endpoints, or poor session management.
- **Mitigation**: Use strong authentication mechanisms, implement proper session management, and secure token storage.

#### 3. Broken Object Property Level Authorization

- **Description**: APIs expose more object properties than necessary or allow modification of sensitive properties.
- **Example**: User profile API returns sensitive data like SSN or allows modification of admin flags.
- **Mitigation**: Implement field-level authorization and data filtering.

#### 4. Unrestricted Resource Consumption

- **Description**: APIs don't properly limit resource consumption, leading to DoS attacks.
- **Example**: APIs without rate limiting, pagination, or request size limits.
- **Mitigation**: Implement rate limiting, request size limits, and proper pagination.

#### 5. Broken Function Level Authorization

- **Description**: APIs expose functions that users shouldn't have access to.
- **Example**: Regular users accessing admin functions by guessing endpoints.
- **Mitigation**: Implement proper function-level authorization checks.

#### 6. Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows

- **Description**: APIs expose business flows without proper access controls.
- **Example**: Purchase flows that don't verify user permissions or payment validation.
- **Mitigation**: Implement business logic validation and access controls.

#### 7. Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

- **Description**: APIs fetch remote resources based on user input without validation.
- **Example**: APIs that fetch URLs provided by users without proper validation.
- **Mitigation**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs, implement URL allowlists.

#### 8. Security Misconfiguration

- **Description**: APIs are deployed with insecure default configurations.
- **Example**: Unnecessary HTTP methods enabled, verbose error messages, or missing security headers.
- **Mitigation**: Follow security hardening guidelines and regular security audits.

#### 9. Improper Inventory Management

- **Description**: Organizations lose track of their APIs and their security status.
- **Example**: Shadow APIs, deprecated APIs still running, or undocumented endpoints.
- **Mitigation**: Maintain an API inventory and lifecycle management process.

#### 10. Unsafe Consumption of APIs

- **Description**: Applications trust data from third-party APIs without proper validation.
- **Example**: Consuming external APIs without validating response data.
- **Mitigation**: Validate all external data and implement proper error handling.

## Implementation Examples

### Implementing JWT Authentication

```javascript
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");
const bcrypt = require("bcrypt");

// Generate JWT token
function generateToken(user) {
  const payload = {
    userId: user.id,
    email: user.email,
    role: user.role,
  };

  return jwt.sign(payload, process.env.JWT_SECRET, {
    expiresIn: "1h",
    issuer: "your-api",
    audience: "your-app",
  });
}

// Middleware to verify JWT
function authenticateToken(req, res, next) {
  const authHeader = req.headers["authorization"];
  const token = authHeader && authHeader.split(" ")[1];

  if (!token) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: "Access token required" });
  }

  jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET, (err, user) => {
    if (err) {
      return res.status(403).json({ error: "Invalid or expired token" });
    }
    req.user = user;
    next();
  });
}
```

### Rate Limiting Implementation

```javascript
const rateLimit = require("express-rate-limit");
const RedisStore = require("rate-limit-redis");
const Redis = require("ioredis");

const redisClient = new Redis(process.env.REDIS_URL);

const limiter = rateLimit({
  store: new RedisStore({
    sendCommand: (...args) => redisClient.call(...args),
  }),
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // Limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  message: {
    error: "Too many requests from this IP, please try again later.",
  },
  standardHeaders: true,
  legacyHeaders: false,
});

// Apply rate limiting to API routes
app.use("/api/", limiter);
```

### Input Validation with Joi

```javascript
const Joi = require("joi");

const userSchema = Joi.object({
  email: Joi.string().email().required(),
  password: Joi.string()
    .min(8)
    .pattern(
      new RegExp("^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[0-9])(?=.*[!@#\$%\^&\*])")
    )
    .required(),
  name: Joi.string().min(2).max(50).required(),
  age: Joi.number().integer().min(18).max(120),
});

function validateUser(req, res, next) {
  const { error } = userSchema.validate(req.body);
  if (error) {
    return res.status(400).json({
      error: "Validation failed",
      details: error.details.map((detail) => detail.message),
    });
  }
  next();
}
```

### CORS Configuration

```javascript
const cors = require("cors");

const corsOptions = {
  origin: function (origin, callback) {
    const allowedOrigins = [
      "https://yourdomain.com",
      "https://app.yourdomain.com",
    ];

    if (!origin || allowedOrigins.includes(origin)) {
      callback(null, true);
    } else {
      callback(new Error("Not allowed by CORS"));
    }
  },
  methods: ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"],
  allowedHeaders: ["Content-Type", "Authorization"],
  credentials: true,
  maxAge: 86400, // 24 hours
};

app.use(cors(corsOptions));
```
