# Automating Tests

## Table of Contents

## Introduction

Automating tests is a crucial practice in software development that enhances the efficiency and reliability of the testing process. It involves using specialized tools and frameworks to execute tests automatically, reducing the need for manual intervention. This approach not only speeds up the testing cycle but also ensures consistent and repeatable test execution, allowing developers to identify and fix issues more quickly. Automated tests can cover various aspects of software, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, providing comprehensive coverage of the application's functionality.

## Key Concepts

- **Test Automation Frameworks**: These are structured environments that provide guidelines and tools for automating tests. They help in organizing test scripts, managing test data, and reporting results.
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: A practice where code changes are automatically tested and integrated into the main codebase. CI tools often include built-in support for running automated tests, ensuring that new code does not break existing functionality.
- **Test Scripts**: These are the actual code written to perform tests. They can be written in various programming languages and are executed by the test automation framework.
- **Assertions**: Assertions are conditions that must be true for a test to pass. They are used to verify that the application behaves as expected during testing.
- **Test Data Management**: This involves creating, maintaining, and managing the data used in tests. Proper test data management ensures that tests are reliable and can be executed consistently.

## Popular Test Automation Tools

### Selenium

- **Description**: An open-source tool for automating web browsers. It supports multiple programming languages and allows for the creation of complex test scripts that can interact with web applications.

    cy.visit("https://example.cypress.io");
    cy.contains("type").click();
    cy.url().should("include", "/commands/actions");
    cy.get(".action-email")
      .type("test@example.com")
      .should("have.value", "test@example.com");
  });
});
```

### Playwright

- **Documentation**: [Playwright Documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro)

```javascript title="tests/basic-test.spec.js"
const { test, expect } = require("@playwright/test");
test("basic test", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto("https://example.com");
  const title = await page.title();
  expect(title).toBe("Example Domain");
});
```

```python title="tests/playwright_test.py"
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright
def run(playwright):
    browser = playwright.chromium.launch()
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto("https://example.com")
    assert page.title() == "Example Domain"
    browser.close()
with sync_playwright() as playwright:
    run(playwright)
```

```java title="src/test/java/PlaywrightExample.java"
import com.microsoft.playwright.*;
import com.microsoft.playwright.Page;
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (Playwright playwright = Playwright.create()) {
            Browser browser = playwright.chromium().launch();
            Page page = browser.newPage();
            page.navigate("https://example.com");
            System.out.println("Title: " + page.title());
            browser.close();
        }
    }
}
```

### JUnit

- **Description**: A widely used testing framework for Java applications, providing annotations and assertions to create and run tests easily.
- **Documentation**: [JUnit Documentation](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/)

```java title="src/test/java/ExampleTest.java"
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
public class ExampleTest {
    @Test
    public void testAddition() {
        int result = add(2, 3);
        assertEquals(5, result);
    }

    private int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

### Mocha

- **Description**: A flexible testing framework for Node.js and browser applications, allowing developers to write tests in a variety of styles (BDD, TDD) and providing support for asynchronous testing.
- **Documentation**: [Mocha Documentation](https://mochajs.org/)

```javascript title="test/add.test.js"
const assert = require("assert");
describe("Addition Tests", () => {
  it("should return the sum of two numbers", () => {
    const result = add(2, 3);
    assert.strictEqual(result, 5);
  });
});
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

### Jest

  expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
});
```

### Jasmine
