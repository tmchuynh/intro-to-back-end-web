## Table of Contents

## Introduction

API versioning is a crucial aspect of API design that allows developers to introduce changes and improvements without breaking existing clients. This guide provides an overview of API versioning strategies, best practices, and implementation examples.

## API Versioning Strategies

API versioning can be implemented using various strategies, each with its own advantages and trade-offs. The most common strategies include:

### URI Versioning

In URI versioning, the version number is included in the URL path. This approach is straightforward and easy to understand, making it a popular choice for many APIs.

```http title="URI Versioning Example"
GET /api/v1/users
GET /api/v2/users
```

### Query Parameter Versioning

In query parameter versioning, the version number is specified as a query parameter in the request URL. This method allows for more flexibility in versioning but can lead to confusion if not documented clearly.

```http title="Query Parameter Versioning Example"
GET /api/users?version=1
GET /api/users?version=2
```

### Header Versioning

Header versioning involves specifying the API version in the request headers. This approach keeps the URL clean and allows for more complex versioning schemes, but it requires clients to handle custom headers.

```http title="Header Versioning Example"
GET /api/users
Accept: application/vnd.example.v1+json
GET /api/users
Accept: application/vnd.example.v2+json
```

### Content Negotiation

Content negotiation allows clients to specify the desired version of the API through the `Accept` header.
This method is flexible and can support multiple versions simultaneously, but it requires careful management of content types.

```http title="Content Negotiation Example"
GET /api/users
Accept: application/vnd.example.v1+json
GET /api/users
Accept: application/vnd.example.v2+json
```

### Semantic Versioning

Semantic versioning (SemVer) is a versioning scheme that uses a three-part version number (major.minor.patch) to indicate changes in the API. This approach provides clear expectations for clients regarding the impact of changes.

```http title="Semantic Versioning Example"
GET /api/v1.0.0/users
GET /api/v1.1.0/users
GET /api/v2.0.0/users
```

### Versioning by Feature Flags

Feature flags allow developers to enable or disable specific features in the API without changing the version. This approach provides flexibility and allows for gradual rollouts of new features.

```http title="Feature Flags Example"
GET /api/users
Feature-Flag: new-feature=true
GET /api/users
Feature-Flag: new-feature=false
```

### Versioning by Subdomains

Subdomain versioning involves using different subdomains for different API versions. This approach can help isolate versions and provide clear separation between them.

```http title="Subdomain Versioning Example"
GET https://v1.api.example.com/users
GET https://v2.api.example.com/users
```

### Versioning by Media Type

Media type versioning uses the `Accept` header to specify the desired version of the API based on the media type. This method allows for fine-grained control over the API response format.

```http title="Media Type Versioning Example"
GET /api/users
Accept: application/vnd.example.v1+json
GET /api/users
Accept: application/vnd.example.v2+json
```

## Best Practices for API Versioning

When implementing API versioning, consider the following best practices:

- **Keep it Simple**: Choose a versioning strategy that is easy to understand and implement. Avoid overcomplicating the versioning scheme.
- **Document Changes**: Clearly document the changes introduced in each version, including breaking changes, new features, and deprecations. This helps clients understand how to adapt to new versions.
- **Use Semantic Versioning**: If applicable, use semantic versioning to communicate the impact of changes. This provides clients with clear expectations about the stability of the API.
- **Deprecate Responsibly**: When introducing a new version, provide a deprecation period for the old version. Notify clients in advance and provide migration guides to help them transition to the new version.
- **Version Granularity**: Consider the granularity of your versioning strategy. For example, if you frequently introduce small changes, a minor versioning scheme (e.g., v1.1) may be more appropriate than a major versioning scheme (e.g, v2).
- **Avoid Breaking Changes**: Strive to minimize breaking changes in new versions. If breaking changes are necessary, provide clear migration paths and support for both old and new versions during the transition period.
- **Monitor Usage**: Track the usage of different API versions to understand client adoption and plan for future deprecations. This helps prioritize which versions to maintain and which to phase out.
- **Versioning in Documentation**: Clearly indicate the version of the API in your documentation. This helps clients identify which version they are using and what changes have been made in each version.
- **Testing**: Implement thorough testing for each API version to ensure compatibility and functionality. Automated tests can help catch issues early and ensure that new versions do not break existing functionality.
- **Versioning in Client Libraries**: If you provide client libraries for your API, ensure that they are versioned alongside the API. This helps clients manage dependencies and ensures compatibility between the client and server.
- **Versioning in SDKs**: If you offer SDKs for different programming languages, version them alongside the API. This ensures that clients using the SDKs are aware of the API version they are interacting with and can adapt to changes accordingly.
- **Versioning in Error Responses**: Include the API version in error responses. This helps clients identify which version of the API they are using when troubleshooting issues.
- **Versioning in Analytics**: If you collect analytics data, include the API version in the data. This allows you to analyze usage patterns and identify which versions are most popular among clients.
- **Versioning in Rate Limiting**: If you implement rate limiting, consider applying it per API version. This allows you to manage traffic and resource usage more effectively across different versions of the API.
- **Versioning in Caching**: If you use caching mechanisms, consider versioning your cache keys based on the API version. This helps ensure that clients receive the correct cached responses for the version they are using.
- **Versioning in Security**: If you implement security measures (e.g., authentication, authorization), ensure that they are compatible with all supported API versions. This helps maintain a consistent security posture across versions.
- **Versioning in Monitoring**: If you use monitoring tools, include the API version in your monitoring metrics. This allows you to track performance and reliability for each version separately and identify any issues that may arise.

This provides clients with a clear history of changes and helps them understand the evolution of the API over time. A well-maintained change log can also serve as a reference for developers when troubleshooting issues or implementing new features.
- **Versioning in Migration Guides**: Provide migration guides for clients transitioning from one version to another. These guides should outline the changes, provide examples of how to adapt to the new version, and highlight any deprecated features. Migration guides can significantly reduce the friction for clients when upgrading to a new version and help them quickly adapt to the changes.
- **Versioning in Client Communication**: When communicating with clients about API changes, be transparent about the reasons for the changes and the benefits they bring. This helps build trust with clients and encourages them to embrace new versions. Additionally, consider providing a feedback mechanism for clients to share their thoughts on the changes, which can help you improve future versions and address any concerns they may have.
- **Versioning in API Gateways**: If you use an API gateway, configure it to handle versioning appropriately. This includes routing requests to the correct version of the API based on the versioning strategy you choose. An API gateway can also help manage authentication, rate limiting, and caching for different API versions, ensuring a consistent experience for clients across versions.
- **Versioning in API Documentation**: Ensure that your API documentation is versioned alongside the API. This includes providing clear instructions on how to use each version, examples of requests and responses, and any specific requirements or limitations for each version. Versioned documentation helps clients quickly find the information they need for the specific version they are using and reduces confusion when multiple versions are available.
- **Versioning in API Testing**: Implement automated tests for each API version to ensure that they function correctly and meet the expected behavior. This includes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests that cover the functionality of each version. Automated testing helps catch issues early and ensures that new versions do not introduce regressions or break existing functionality. Additionally, consider using contract testing to verify that the API adheres to the expected contract for each version, ensuring compatibility between clients and the server.
