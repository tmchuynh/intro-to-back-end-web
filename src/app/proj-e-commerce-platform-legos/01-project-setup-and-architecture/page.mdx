# Module 1: Project Setup and Architecture

## Overview

This module covers the initial setup and architectural design of the full-stack e-commerce platform for Legos. You'll learn about system architecture, technology choices, and development environment setup.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the overall system architecture
- Set up the development environment
- Learn about microservices vs monolithic architecture
- Understand the technology stack rationale
- Set up project structure and development tools

## Topics Covered

### 1.1 System Architecture Design

- **Monolithic vs Microservices**: Understanding trade-offs
- **Three-tier architecture**: Presentation, Business Logic, Data layers
- **API-first design**: Building scalable interfaces
- **Separation of concerns**: Frontend, Backend, Database boundaries

### 1.2 Technology Stack Rationale

- **CockroachDB**: Why choose a distributed SQL database
- **Django**: Benefits for rapid backend development
- **TypeScript**: Type safety for large-scale frontend applications
- **React/Next.js**: Modern frontend framework selection
- **Prometheus**: Monitoring and observability strategy

### 1.3 Development Environment Setup

- **Development tools**: IDEs, version control, package managers
- **Local development**: Docker Compose for local stack
- **Environment management**: Development, staging, production
- **Code quality tools**: Linters, formatters, pre-commit hooks

### 1.4 Project Structure and Organization

```

### 1.5 Development Workflow

- **Git workflow**: Feature branches, pull requests, code reviews
- **CI/CD pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment
- **Documentation standards**: API docs, code comments
- **Issue tracking**: Project management and bug tracking

## Hands-On Exercises

### Exercise 1.1: Environment Setup

1. Install required development tools
2. Set up Docker and Docker Compose
3. Configure IDE with extensions and settings
4. Set up Git repository with proper .gitignore

### Exercise 1.2: Architecture Planning

1. Create system architecture diagram
2. Define API endpoints structure
3. Plan database schema overview
4. Design component hierarchy for frontend

### Exercise 1.3: Project Initialization

1. Initialize Django backend project
2. Set up TypeScript/React frontend
3. Configure development Docker containers
4. Set up basic project documentation

## Key Concepts

- **API-First Design**: Designing APIs before implementation
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Organizing code around business domains
- **SOLID Principles**: Writing maintainable and scalable code
- **12-Factor App**: Best practices for modern applications

## Tools and Technologies Introduced

- **Docker & Docker Compose**: Containerization for consistent development
- **Git**: Version control best practices
- **VSCode/IDE**: Development environment optimization
- **Postman/Insomnia**: API testing tools
- **Draw.io/Lucidchart**: Architecture diagramming

## Next Steps

After completing this module, proceed to [Module 2: Database Design and CockroachDB Setup](../02-database-design-and-cockroachdb-setup) to design and implement the database layer.
