# Database Clients

## Table of Contents

## Introduction

Database clients are software applications that allow users to interact with databases. They provide a user interface for executing queries, managing data, and performing administrative tasks. Common database clients include command-line tools, graphical user interfaces (GUIs), and integrated development environments (IDEs).

## Key Features of Database Clients

- **Query Execution**: Run SQL queries and view results.
- **Data Management**: Insert, update, delete, and view data in tables.
- **Schema Management**: Create, modify, and delete database schemas and objects.
- **User Management**: Manage database users and permissions.
- **Backup and Restore**: Perform database backups and restores.
