# Database Schema Design and Migration

## Table of Contents

## Introduction

Database schema design is a critical aspect of database management that involves defining the structure, organization, and relationships of data within a database. It serves as a blueprint for how data is stored, accessed, and manipulated. A well-designed schema ensures data integrity, reduces redundancy, and enhances query performance.
Schema design is not a one-time task; it evolves as application requirements change. Migration refers to the process of modifying the database schema to accommodate new features, optimize performance, or adapt to changing business needs. This can involve adding new tables, modifying existing ones, or changing relationships between tables.

Database migration is the process of transferring data from one database to another or modifying the structure of an existing database. It is essential for maintaining data integrity, ensuring compatibility with new applications, and optimizing performance. Migration can involve various tasks, such as schema changes, data transformations, and data validation.

## Schema Design

### Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)

Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) are visual representations of the entities, attributes, and relationships within a database. They help in understanding the data model and serve as a blueprint for database design. ERDs consist of entities (tables), attributes (columns), and relationships (connections between tables).

ERDs are essential for database design as they provide a clear and concise way to visualize the structure of the database. They help identify the main data components and their interactions, which is crucial for building an effective database structure. ERDs also serve as a communication tool among stakeholders, ensuring a shared understanding of the data model.

Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) are a graphical representation of the entities in a database and their relationships. They are used to visualize the structure of the database and to communicate the design to stakeholders. ERDs consist of:

- **Entities**: Represented as rectangles, entities are objects or concepts that have data stored about them. For example, in a library database, entities could include `Books`, `Authors`, and `Members`.
- **Attributes**: Represented as ovals, attributes are the properties or characteristics of an entity. For example, a `Book` entity might have attributes like `Title`, `Author`, and `Publication Year`.
- **Relationships**: Represented as diamonds, relationships show how entities are related to each other. For example, a `Book` entity might have a relationship with an `Author` entity, indicating that a book is written by an author.
- **Cardinality**: Indicates the number of instances of one entity that can or must be associated with each instance of another entity. Common cardinalities include one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many.

#### Example

For instance, in a simple library database, an ERD might include:

```txt
[Book] --< [Author]
[Member] --< [Loan]
```

In this example:

- The `Book` entity has a one-to-many relationship with the `Author` entity, indicating that a book can have one author, but an author can write multiple books.
- The `Member` entity has a one-to-many relationship with the `Loan` entity, indicating that a member can borrow multiple books, but each loan is associated with one member.

There are various notations for ERDs, including [Chen notation](https://vertabelo.com/blog/chen-erd-notation/), [Crow's Foot notation](https://vertabelo.com/blog/crow-s-foot-notation/), and [UML notation](https://vertabelo.com/blog/uml-notation/). Each notation has its own conventions for representing entities, attributes, and relationships, but the core concepts remain consistent across them.

In the context of database design, ERDs serve as a blueprint for the database structure. They help designers and developers visualize the data model, identify potential issues, and ensure that all necessary entities and relationships are captured before implementation begins. ERDs can also be used to generate database schemas in various database management systems, streamlining the transition from design to implementation.

##### NOTE

> Linked in the optional actions table at the bottom of the page, there is a section for [documentation and schema visualization tools](/util-documentation-and-schema-visualization-tools) that can help you create ERDs. These tools often provide features for collaboration, version control, and integration with database management systems, making it easier to maintain and update the data model as requirements evolve.

ERDs are a powerful tool for database design, as they provide a clear and concise way to visualize the structure of the database. They help identify the main data components and their interactions, which is essential for building an effective database structure. ERDs also serve as a communication tool among stakeholders, ensuring a shared understanding of the data model.

ERDs can be created using various diagramming tools, such as Lucidchart, Draw.io, or dedicated database modeling software. These tools often provide templates and features to help users create and modify ERDs easily. Once created, ERDs can be shared with team members and stakeholders to gather feedback and make necessary adjustments before proceeding with the database implementation.

ERDs play a vital role in database design by offering a clear visual representation of entities and their relationships. They help identify the main data components and how they interact, which is essential for building an effective database structure. ERDs are typically developed during the conceptual design phase and serve as a communication tool among stakeholders, ensuring a shared understanding of the data model. These diagrams also guide the transition from conceptual to logical and physical database design. ERDs can be created using diagramming tools such as Lucidchart, Draw.io, or dedicated database modeling software, and they remain a valuable reference throughout the development and implementation process.

## Data Migration

Data migration is the process of transferring data from one database to another or modifying the structure of an existing database. It is essential for maintaining data integrity, ensuring compatibility with new applications, and optimizing performance. Migration can involve various tasks, such as schema changes, data transformations, and data validation.

Data migration is a critical aspect of database management, especially when upgrading systems, consolidating databases, or transitioning to new technologies. It involves moving data from one storage system to another, which can include transferring data between different database management systems (DBMS), migrating from on-premises databases to cloud-based solutions, or restructuring data to fit new application requirements.

Data migration can be complex and requires careful planning to ensure that data is transferred accurately and without loss. It often involves several steps, including:

1. **Assessment**: Analyzing the existing database structure, data types, and relationships to understand the scope of the migration. This step helps identify potential challenges and ensures that the new database design meets application requirements.
2. **Planning**: Developing a migration strategy that outlines the steps to be taken, the tools to be used, and the timeline for the migration process.
3. **Data Profiling**: Examining the data to identify inconsistencies, duplicates, and other issues that may affect the migration. This step helps ensure data quality and integrity in the new database.
4. **Data Backup**: Creating backups of the existing data to prevent data loss during the migration process. This is a crucial step to ensure that data can be restored in case of any issues during migration.
5. **Migration Design**: Designing the new database schema based on the requirements and the results of the assessment. This includes defining tables, fields, relationships, and constraints.
6. **Data Transformation**: Modifying the data to fit the new database schema or format. This may involve changing data types, renaming fields, or restructuring relationships between tables.
7. **Execution**: Moving the data from the source database to the target database.
   This can be done using various tools and techniques, such as ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, database migration tools, or custom scripts.
8. **Data Validation**: Verifying that the data has been transferred correctly and that the new database structure meets the requirements. This step involves checking for data integrity, consistency, and completeness.
9. **Testing**: Conducting tests to ensure that the new database functions as expected and that applications can access and manipulate the data correctly. This includes functional testing, performance testing, and user acceptance testing.
10. **Deployment**: Making the new database available for use by applications and users. This may involve updating application configurations, training users, and monitoring the system for any issues.

### Example

For example, if a company is migrating from an on-premises SQL Server database to a cloud-based PostgreSQL database, the migration process might involve:

- Assessing the existing SQL Server schema and data types.
- Planning the migration strategy, including selecting tools like AWS Database Migration Service or custom scripts.
- Transforming data types to match PostgreSQL requirements (e.g., converting `DATETIME` to `TIMESTAMP`).
- Executing the migration by transferring data using the chosen tool.
- Validating the data in the PostgreSQL database to ensure accuracy and completeness.

### Types of Database Migration

- **Migration-Based Migration**: This type of migration involves moving data from one database to another, often between different database management systems (DBMS). It typically includes transferring data, schema, and relationships while ensuring data integrity and compatibility with the new system.
- **State-Based Migration**: This type of migration focuses on modifying the structure of an existing database without changing the underlying data. It involves altering tables, adding or removing columns, and updating relationships to accommodate new application requirements or optimize performance.
- **Schema Migration**: This type of migration specifically deals with changes to the database schema, such as adding new tables, modifying existing ones, or changing relationships between tables. Schema migrations are often used to adapt the database structure to evolving application needs.
