## Choosing a Database

When selecting a database for your application, consider the following criteria:

- **Data Model**: Choose a database that aligns with your data structure (e.g., relational, document, key-value).
- **Scalability**: Ensure the database can handle your expected data growth and user load.
- **Performance**: Evaluate the database's read and write speeds, especially for your specific use cases.
- **Consistency vs. Availability**: Decide whether you prioritize strong consistency or high availability in your application.
- **Community and Support**: Consider the size of the community and the availability of support resources for the database.
- **Cost**: Assess the total cost of ownership, including licensing, hosting, and maintenance costs.

Later in the course, we will explore specific databases and their features in more detail, helping you make informed decisions based on your application's requirements.
