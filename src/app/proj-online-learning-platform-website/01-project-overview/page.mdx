# Online Learning Platform Project Overview

## Table of Contents

## Introduction

In this comprehensive project, we'll build a full-stack online learning platform using MongoDB, Spring Boot, and a modern frontend with TailwindCSS. This platform will allow instructors to create and manage courses, and students to enroll in courses, track their progress, participate in discussions, and complete assessments.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for custom designs
- **Axios**: For HTTP requests to the backend API

### Backend

- **Spring Boot**: A Java-based framework for building robust backend applications
- **Spring Data MongoDB**: For MongoDB data access and repositories
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL document database for storing course content, user data, and more
- **Spring Security**: For authentication and authorization
- **Argon2**: A secure password hashing algorithm
- **JWT**: For stateless authentication

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or later
- Maven
- MongoDB (local installation or cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)
- Node.js and npm
- Git

## Project Components

Our online learning platform will include the following key components:

1. **User Management**
   - Registration and authentication with Argon2 password hashing
   - User profiles (students, instructors, administrators)
   - Role-based access control

2. **Course Management**
   - Course creation and editing
   - Curriculum organization (modules, lessons, topics)
   - Course metadata (descriptions, learning objectives, prerequisites)

3. **Content Delivery**
   - Video lectures
   - Reading materials
   - Downloadable resources

4. **Learning Experience**
   - Progress tracking
   - Bookmarking
   - Notes taking

5. **Assessment System**
   - Quizzes and tests
   - Assignments
   - Grading and feedback

6. **Interaction**
   - Discussion forums
   - Comments
   - Direct messaging

7. **Administration**
   - User management
   - Content moderation
   - Analytics and reporting

## Project Structure Overview

We'll organize our project with a clear separation between the backend and frontend:

```
learning-platform/
├── backend/                 # Spring Boot application
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── main/
│   │   │   ├── java/       # Java source files
│   │   │   └── resources/  # Configuration files
│   │   └── test/           # Test files
│   └── pom.xml             # Maven configuration
│
└── frontend/               # React application
    ├── public/             # Static files
    ├── src/                # React source files
    │   ├── components/     # UI components
    │   ├── pages/          # Page components
    │   ├── services/       # API services
    │   └── utils/          # Utility functions
    ├── package.json        # npm configuration
    └── tailwind.config.js  # TailwindCSS configuration
```

## Next Steps

In the following modules, we'll step through each phase of development:

1. Setting up MongoDB
2. Designing our database schema
3. Creating the Spring Boot application
4. Integrating Spring Boot with MongoDB
5. Implementing data models and repositories
6. Building RESTful APIs
7. Adding authentication with Argon2
8. Developing the frontend with React and TailwindCSS
9. And much more...
