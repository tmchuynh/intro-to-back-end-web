# Relational Databases

## Table of Contents

## Introduction to Relational Databases

Relational databases are a type of database that store data in structured formats using rows and columns. They are based on the relational model, which was first introduced by Edgar F. Codd in 1970. This model organizes data into tables that can be linked or related based on data common to each table, creating a comprehensive data management system that allows for complex queries and data manipulation.

Think of a relational database like a collection of interconnected spreadsheets. Each spreadsheet (table) contains related information, and you can reference data from one table in another table. For example, you might have a "Customers" table and an "Orders" table, where each order references a specific customer.

Developers use relational databases to manage large amounts of structured data efficiently. They provide powerful querying capabilities through SQL (Structured Query Language), which allows developers to perform operations like data retrieval, insertion, updating, and deletion. The relational model ensures data consistency and reduces redundancy through normalization processes.

### Real-World Example

Consider an e-commerce application where you need to store information about customers, products, and orders. In a relational database, you would create separate tables for each entity:

```sql title="E-Commerce Database"
-- Customers table
CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    phone VARCHAR(20)
);

-- Products table
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(100),
    price DECIMAL(10,2),
    category VARCHAR(50),
    stock_quantity INT
);

-- Orders table
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    order_date DATE,
    total_amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
);
```

## Key Concepts

Understanding the fundamental concepts of relational databases is essential for working with them effectively. These concepts form the foundation of how data is organized, stored, and retrieved in relational database systems.

### Tables

Tables are the basic structure of a relational database, consisting of rows and columns. Each table represents a specific entity or concept in your data model. A table is similar to a spreadsheet where each column represents an attribute and each row represents a record.

They are defined by their structure, which includes the table name, columns, and data types for each column. The table structure is defined using SQL commands.

```sql title="Simple Users Table"
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Rows and Records

Rows, also called records or tuples, represent individual instances of the entity that the table represents. Each row contains data for all the columns defined in the table structure.

Each row in a table corresponds to a single record, and each record contains values for each column in that table. For example, in the "users" table, each row would represent a different user with their specific details.

```sql title="Inserting Data into a Users Table"
INSERT INTO users (id, username, email)
VALUES (1, 'john_doe', 'john@example.com');

INSERT INTO users (id, username, email)
VALUES (2, 'jane_smith', 'jane@example.com');
```

### Columns and Attributes

Columns, also called attributes or fields, represent the properties or characteristics of the entity. Each column has a specific data type that defines what kind of data can be stored in that column.

```sql title="Defining Columns"
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    category VARCHAR(50),
    stock_quantity INT
);
```

### Primary Key and Composite Primary Key

A primary key is a column or combination of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. No two rows can have the same primary key value, and primary key values cannot be null.

A primary key is essential for maintaining data integrity and ensuring that each record can be uniquely identified. This is crucial for operations like updating or deleting specific records without ambiguity.

```sql title="Defining a Primary Key"
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,        -- Single column primary key
    product_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL(10,2)
);

-- Alternative syntax for composite primary key
CREATE TABLE order_items (
    order_id INT,
    product_id INT,
    quantity INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (order_id, product_id)  -- Composite primary key using multiple columns
);
```

#### Single Primary Key VS Composite Primary Key

A single primary key consists of one column that uniquely identifies each record in a table. A composite primary key, on the other hand, is made up of two or more columns that together uniquely identify a record. Composite keys are useful when no single column can uniquely identify a record.

##### Benefits of a Single Primary Key

- Simplicity: Easier to manage and understand.
- Performance: Generally faster for lookups and joins.

##### Benefits of a Composite Primary Key

- Flexibility: Allows for more complex relationships between tables.
- Uniqueness: Ensures that the combination of multiple attributes is unique across records.

## Benefits of Relational Databases

Relational databases offer numerous advantages that make them the preferred choice for many applications, from small personal projects to large enterprise systems.

### Structured Data Organization

Relational databases provide a structured way to organize data into tables, making it easy to understand and manage. Each table represents a specific entity, and relationships between tables can be established through foreign keys.

```sql title="Structured Data Organization"
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    department_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(department_id)
);
```

### Data Integrity and Consistency

Relational databases ensure accuracy and consistency of data through constraints, relationships, and validation rules. The system automatically enforces these rules to prevent invalid data from being stored.

This is achieved through primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and check constraints. These features help maintain data integrity and prevent anomalies.

```sql title="Data Integrity Constraints"
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,    -- Ensures unique emails
    age INT CHECK (age >= 18 AND age <= 65), -- Age validation
    department_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(id)
);
```

### Flexibility and Complex Queries

Relational databases allow for sophisticated data manipulation and querying capabilities through SQL. You can join multiple tables, filter data, aggregate results, and perform complex calculations.

Because of this flexibility, relational databases are well-suited for applications that require complex data relationships and reporting.

```sql title="Joining Multiple Tables"
SELECT
    c.customer_name,
    COUNT(o.order_id) as total_orders,
    SUM(o.total_amount) as total_spent
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.order_date >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.customer_name
HAVING total_spent > 1000
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;
```

#### Advantages of Complex Queries

Complex queries allow developers to extract meaningful insights from data by combining information from multiple tables. This is particularly useful for generating reports, analyzing trends, and making data-driven decisions.

### Scalability

Modern relational databases can handle large volumes of data and complex transactions efficiently through various optimization techniques including indexing, partitioning, and caching. This scalability makes them suitable for applications ranging from small websites to large enterprise systems.

### Transaction Management

Transaction management is a critical aspect of relational databases, allowing developers to group multiple operations into a single unit of work. This ensures that either all operations succeed or none do, maintaining data integrity.

```sql title="Transaction Management"
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 2;
-- Either both updates succeed or both fail
COMMIT;
```

### ACID Compliance

ACID properties ensure reliable transactions through Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. This guarantees that database transactions are processed reliably. It ensures that all operations within a transaction are completed successfully or none at all, maintaining data integrity.

```sql title="a transaction demonstrating ACID properties"
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 2;

-- Either both updates succeed or both fail (Atomicity)
COMMIT;
```

### Additional Benefits

#### Data Redundancy Reduction

Normalization helps eliminate duplicate data, saving storage space and improving performance while ensuring data consistency across the database. There is no need to store the same information in multiple places, which reduces the risk of data anomalies. This also simplifies data management and makes updates easier, as changes need to be made in only one place. Developers can focus on maintaining a single source of truth for each piece of data.

#### Security Features

Relational databases provide robust security mechanisms including user authentication, role-based access control, and data encryption. These features help protect sensitive data and ensure that only authorized users can access or modify the data. They also allow for fine-grained access control, enabling developers to define who can read, write, or modify specific tables or columns.

```sql title="security implementation"
-- Creating users with specific permissions
CREATE USER 'app_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'secure_password';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON orders TO 'app_user'@'localhost';
GRANT SELECT ON customers TO 'app_user'@'localhost';
```

#### Industry Standard and Portability

Relational databases are widely used across various industries, and SQL is the de facto standard for interacting with these databases. This means that developers can easily switch between different relational database management systems (RDBMS) without having to learn a new query language.

## Common Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)
