## Table of Contents

## Introduction

API management is a crucial aspect of modern software development, enabling organizations to create, publish, secure, and monitor APIs effectively. It involves the use of tools and practices to manage the entire lifecycle of APIs, from design and development to deployment and monitoring. API management helps ensure that APIs are reliable, secure, and scalable, allowing developers to build applications that can easily integrate with various services and data sources.
API management platforms provide features such as API gateways, documentation, analytics, and security controls to streamline the API development process. They also facilitate collaboration between teams, enabling them to create APIs that meet business requirements and adhere to industry standards. By implementing effective API management practices, organizations can enhance their software development processes, improve developer productivity, and deliver high-quality APIs that drive innovation and business growth.
