# Introduction to Object Relational Mappers (ORMs)

## Table of Contents

## Introduction

Object Relational Mappers (ORMs) are tools that facilitate the interaction between object-oriented programming languages and relational databases. They allow developers to work with database records as if they were regular objects in their code, abstracting away the complexities of SQL queries and database interactions. This can significantly speed up development time and reduce the amount of boilerplate code needed to perform database operations.

## Key Concepts

- **Object Mapping**: ORMs map database tables to classes in the programming language, allowing developers to interact with database records as objects.
- **CRUD Operations**: ORMs provide methods for Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations, enabling developers to perform database operations without writing raw SQL queries.
- **Relationships**: ORMs handle relationships between tables (e.g., one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many) by allowing developers to define associations between classes, which correspond to foreign key relationships in the database.
- **Query Building**: ORMs often include query builders that allow developers to construct complex queries using a fluent API, making it easier to write and maintain database queries without resorting to raw SQL.
- **Migration Management**: Many ORMs provide tools for managing database schema migrations, allowing developers to version control their database schema changes and apply them consistently across different environments.

## JavaScript/TypeScript

- **Sequelize**: A promise-based Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server.
- **TypeORM**: An ORM for TypeScript and JavaScript (ES7, ES6, ES5) that supports various databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and more.
- **Prisma**: A next-generation ORM that simplifies database access with an intuitive API and type safety.
- **Objection.js**: A SQL-friendly ORM for Node.js that is built on top of the SQL query builder Knex.js, providing a powerful and flexible way to interact with databases.
- **Waterline**: An ORM for Node.js that provides a simple data access layer, supporting multiple databases and data sources.
- **MikroORM**: A TypeScript ORM for Node.js based on the Data Mapper pattern, supporting multiple databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and MongoDB.
- **Bookshelf.js**: A JavaScript ORM for Node.js, built on top of Knex.js, that provides a simple and elegant way to work with relational databases.
- **LoopBack**: A highly extensible Node.js framework that includes an ORM for building APIs and connecting to databases, supporting various data sources.

## Python

- **SQLAlchemy**: A powerful and flexible ORM for Python that provides a full suite of tools for working with relational databases.
- **Django ORM**: The built-in ORM for the Django web framework, which provides a high-level abstraction for database interactions.
- **Peewee**: A small, expressive ORM for Python that provides a simple and intuitive API for working with databases.
- **Tortoise-ORM**: An easy-to-use asyncio ORM inspired by Django, designed for Python 3.6+.
- **Pony ORM**: An ORM that allows developers to write database queries using Python generators, providing a more Pythonic way to interact with databases.

## Java

- **Hibernate**: A widely used ORM framework for Java that provides a powerful and flexible way to map Java objects to database tables.
- **JPA (Java Persistence API)**: A specification for ORM in Java that provides a standard way to manage relational data in Java applications. Hibernate is a popular implementation of JPA.
- **MyBatis**: A persistence framework that offers mapping of SQL statements to Java objects, providing a more manual approach compared to traditional ORMs.
- **Spring Data JPA**: A part of the Spring Framework that simplifies database access by providing a repository abstraction over JPA.
- **EclipseLink**: The reference implementation of JPA, providing advanced features like caching and batch processing.
- **Apache OpenJPA**: An open-source implementation of JPA that provides a flexible and powerful ORM solution for Java applications.

## C#

- **Entity Framework**: A popular ORM for .NET applications that allows developers to work with databases using C# objects.
- **Dapper**: A lightweight ORM for .NET that provides a simple way to map database results to C# objects.
- **NHibernate**: An ORM for .NET that is a port of the Java Hibernate framework, providing a powerful and flexible way to map C# objects to database tables.
- **LINQ to SQL**: A simple ORM for .NET that allows developers to query SQL Server databases using LINQ (Language Integrated Query).
- **LLBLGen Pro**: A commercial ORM for .NET that provides a powerful and flexible way to map C# objects to database tables, with support for multiple database providers.

## Benefits of Using ORMs

- **Increased Productivity**: ORMs reduce the amount of boilerplate code needed to interact with databases, allowing developers to focus on business logic rather than database management.
- **Improved Maintainability**: By abstracting database interactions, ORMs make it easier to change the underlying database without affecting the application code. This can be particularly useful when switching between different database systems or when making schema changes.
- **Enhanced Security**: ORMs can help prevent SQL injection attacks by automatically escaping user input and generating parameterized queries. This reduces the risk of security vulnerabilities in the application.
- **Cross-Database Compatibility**: Many ORMs support multiple database systems, allowing developers to switch between different databases without significant code changes. This can be beneficial for applications that need to support multiple database backends or for projects that may change their database technology in the future.
- **Faster Prototyping**: ORMs enable rapid application development by allowing developers to quickly create and manipulate database records without writing complex SQL queries. This can speed up the development process, especially during the early stages of a project when requirements may change frequently.
