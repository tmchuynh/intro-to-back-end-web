## Client-Server Architecture

### Overview

The client-server model is a fundamental distributed application structure that partitions tasks and responsibilities between two distinct entities. This architecture forms the backbone of modern web applications and networked systems, providing a clear separation of concerns and enabling scalable, maintainable applications.

In this model:

- **Clients**: Applications or systems that request services, resources, or data from servers. Clients initiate communication and consume services.
- **Servers**: Applications or systems that provide services, resources, or data to clients. Servers respond to client requests and manage shared resources.

### Historical Context and Evolution

The client-server architecture evolved from mainframe computing models:

| Era               | Period        | Key Characteristics                                                                                                                    |

### Communication Flow

#### Request-Response Cycle

The communication between clients and servers follows a well-defined pattern:

1. Client sends a request to the server
2. Server receives and validates the request
3. Server processes the request according to business logic
4. Server performs necessary operations (database queries, computations, external API calls)
5. Server formats and sends a response back to the client
6. Client receives and processes the response
7. Client updates the user interface with the new data

#### Types of Communication Patterns

| Pattern Type | Characteristics                                                                                        | Use Cases                                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Synchronous  | Client waits for server response, simple to implement, can cause blocking behavior                     | Traditional web applications, REST APIs, simple request-response scenarios |

## Architectural Patterns

### Model-View-Controller (MVC)

#### Overview

MVC is a widely adopted architectural pattern that separates application concerns into three interconnected components:

- Model: Manages data and business logic
- View: Handles presentation and user interface
- Controller: Manages user input and coordinates between Model and View

#### Benefits

- Clear separation of concerns and responsibilities
- Improved code organization and maintainability
- Easier testing and debugging of individual components
- Reusable components across different parts of application
- Support for multiple views of the same data

#### Implementation Examples

- Web frameworks: Django (Python), Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET MVC
- Desktop applications: Swing (Java), WPF (.NET)
- Mobile applications: iOS MVC, Android Architecture Components

### Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)

#### Overview

MVVM extends MVC by introducing a ViewModel layer that acts as a binding layer between View and Model:

- Model: Data and business logic
- View: User interface and presentation
- ViewModel: Exposes data and commands to the View

#### Advantages

- Two-way data binding between View and ViewModel
- Better testability through ViewModel abstraction
- Reduced code-behind in View components
- Improved separation between UI and business logic

### Repository Pattern

#### Purpose

The Repository pattern encapsulates data access logic and provides a more object-oriented view of the persistence layer:

- Centralizes data access logic
- Provides consistent interface for data operations
- Enables easier unit testing through mock repositories
- Separates domain models from data access concerns

#### Implementation

- Generic repository interfaces for common operations
- Specific repository implementations for different data sources
- Unit of Work pattern for transaction management
- Dependency injection for repository abstraction

### Service Layer Pattern

#### Overview

Service layer provides an application's business logic and coordinates between different domain objects:

- Encapsulates business rules and workflows
- Provides transactional boundaries
- Coordinates between multiple domain objects
- Exposes simplified interface to presentation layer

#### Benefits

- Clear separation between business logic and presentation
- Reusable business operations across different interfaces
- Easier testing of business logic in isolation
- Consistent transaction management

## Performance Considerations

| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Round Robin          | Requests distributed sequentially across servers | Simple implementation, fair distribution                     | No consideration of server capacity or load           |
| Weighted Round Robin | Assigns weights to servers based on capacity     | Better resource utilization, adaptable to different hardware | Requires manual weight configuration                  |
| Least Connections    | Routes to server with fewest active connections  | Better for long-running requests, dynamic load adaptation    | Slight overhead tracking connections                  |
| IP Hash              | Routes based on client IP address                | Session affinity, consistent routing                         | Potential uneven distribution with limited client IPs |

| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Time-based Expiration    | Cache entries expire after specified time | Simple implementation, predictable behavior | May serve stale data if updates occur frequently    |
| Event-based Invalidation | Cache invalidated when data changes       | Immediate consistency, always fresh data    | Complex implementation, requires event coordination |
| Manual Invalidation      | Explicit cache clearing by application    | Full control over cache lifecycle           | Risk of serving stale data if invalidation missed   |

| ------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Unit Testing        | Individual components  | Fast            | Isolated with mocks         | Critical business logic     |
| Integration Testing | Component interactions | Medium          | Real dependencies           | Data flow and communication |
| End-to-End Testing  | Complete workflows     | Slow            | Full system                 | User scenarios and behavior |
| Performance Testing | System under load      | Variable        | Production-like environment | Bottlenecks and scalability |
